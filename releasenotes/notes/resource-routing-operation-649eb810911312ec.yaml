    Resource routing APIs add operations on resource routing
    table. This makes it possible to create, show, delete
    and update the resource routing entry in the resource
    routing by cloud administrator for the maintenance and
    emergency fix need. But the update and delete operations
    on the entry generated by the Tricircle itself is not
    proposed, because central Neutron may make wrong
    judgement on whether the resource exists or not
    without this routing entry. Moreover, related request
    can not be forwarded to the proper local Neutron
    either. So even though the update and delete operations
    are provided, they are better not to be used in case of
    causing unexpected problems.
