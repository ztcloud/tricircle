    Note for Networking

    * Only Local Network and VLAN network supported.
      Local Network means the network will only present in one region,
      it could be VxLAN or VLAN network.
      VLAN is the only L2 network type which supports cross
      Neutron L2 networking and the bridge network for L3 networking.
    * Pagination and sort are not supported at the same time for list
      operation.
    * For security group rule, remote group is not supported yet. Use IP
      prefix to create security group rule.
    * One availability zone can include more than one region through
      Tricircle pod management.
    * Availability zone or region name for availability zone hint can be
      specified during network creation, that means this network will be
      presented in the specified list of availability zone or region. If no
      availability zone hint is specified and the network is not Local
      Network, then the network can be spread into all regions. For Local
      Network without availability zone hint specified in creation, then
      the network will only be presented in the first region where the
      resource(VM, baremetal or container) is booted and plugged into this
      network.
    * Need to specify one region name as the availability zone hint for
      external network creation, that means the external network will
      be located in the specified region.
